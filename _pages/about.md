About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) in the [Cryptography and Security Group](https://cs.nyu.edu/cryptosec/). I am advised by [Professor Marshall Ball](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mmb586/) and [Professor Yevgeniy Dodis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~dodis/). I study theoretical cryptography, technology policy, and policy-informed technology designed. In general, I am interested in trying to understand the theoretical limits of what we can and can't achieve digitally to design systems that are private, transparent, and secure. A full list of my publications can be found here. 

In addition to my academic work, I am a freelance journalist covering technology and AI. I was a [2025 AAAS Mass Media Fellow](https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship/peter-hall), which allowed me to get newsroom experience with MIT Technology Review. My writing has appeared in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/peter-hall/), [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/peterhall/), and [Undark Magazine](https://undark.org/author/peter-hall/).
